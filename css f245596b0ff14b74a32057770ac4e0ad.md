**What Is CSS?**

CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets language and is used to stylize elements written in a markup language such as HTML. It separates the content from the visual representation of the site. The relation between HTML and CSS is strongly tied together since HTML is the very foundation of a site and CSS is all of the aesthetics of an entire website.

**CSS Advantages on Web Pages**

The difference between a web page that implements CSS and one that doesn’t is massive and surely noticeable.

You might have seen a website that fails to load completely and has a white background color with most of the text being blue and black. This means that the CSS part of the web page didn’t load correctly or it doesn’t exist altogether.

That’s what web pages with only HTML look like, and I think you’d agree that that’s not very appealing.

Before using CSS, all of the stylizing had to be included into the HTML markup. This means web developers had to separately describe the background color, font size, alignments, etc.

CSS lets you stylize everything on a different file, thus creating the design there and later on integrating the CSS files on top of the HTML markup. This makes the actual HTML markup much cleaner and easier to maintain.

In short, with CSS features you don’t need to repeatedly describe how individual elements look. This saves time, shortens the code, and makes it not as prone to errors.

CSS lets you have multiple styles on one HTML page, therefore making the customization possibilities almost endless. Nowadays, this is becoming more a necessity than a commodity.

**How Does CSS Work?**

CSS uses a simple English based syntax with a set of rules that govern it. Like we’ve mentioned before, HTML was never intended to use style elements, only the markup of the page. It was created to merely describe the content. For example:
**<p>This is a paragraph.</p>**.

But how do you style the paragraph? The CSS syntax structure is pretty simple. It has a selector and a declaration block. You select an element and then declare what you want to do with it. Pretty straightforward, right?

However, there are rules you have to remember. The structure rules are pretty simple, so don’t worry.

The selector points to the HTML elements you want to style. The declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons.

Each declaration includes a CSS property name and a value, separated by a colon. A CSS declaration always ends with a semicolon, and declaration blocks are surrounded by curly braces.

# **Selectors**

| Selector | Description | Example | Example description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/sel_id.asphttps://www.w3schools.com/cssref/sel_id.asp | used to select one unique element and an id name cannot start with a number | #firstname {
  text-align: center;
  color: red;
} | Selects the element with id="firstname" |
| https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/sel_class.asphttps://www.w3schools.com/cssref/sel_class.asp | https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/sel_class.aspSelects HTML elements with a specific class attribute and a class name cannot start with a number. | .intro {
  text-align: center;
  color: red;
} | Selects all elements with class="intro" |
| https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/sel_element_class.asp | specify that only specific HTML elements can be affected by a class. | p.intro {
  text-align: center;
  color: red;
} | Selects only <p> elements with class="intro" |
| * (Universal Selector) | selects all HTML elements on the page | * {
  text-align: center;
  color: blue;
} | Selects all elements |
| https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/sel_element.asp |  | p {
  text-align: center;
  color: red;
} | Selects all <p> elements |
| https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/sel_element_comma.asp(grouping selector) | selects all the HTML elements with the same style definitions. | div, p | Selects all <div> elements and all <p> elements |

**Three Ways to Insert CSS**

• **External CSS**

Is method of defining the styles for HTML elements in a separate file, distinct from the HTML document itself and must be saved with a .css extension.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

<head>

<link rel="stylesheet" href="mystyle.css">

</head>

<body>

<h1>This is a heading</h1>

<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

</body>

</html>
```

**•  Internal CSS**

Is defined inside the <style> element, inside the head section.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
body {
  background-color: linen;
}

h1 {
  color: maroon;
  margin-left: 40px;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<h1>This is a heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>

```

• **Inline CSS**

It involves styling HTML elements directly within the HTML file using the style attribute. This method allows you to apply styles directly to individual elements.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h1 style="color:blue;text-align:center;">This is a heading</h1>
<p style="color:red;">This is a paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>
```

# **CSS Comments**

Comment is placed inside the `<style>` element, and starts with `/*` and ends with `*/`

```css
/* This is a single-line comment */
p {
  color: red;
}
```

**CSS Colors**

specified using predefined color names, or RGB, HEX, HSL, RGBA, HSLA values.

**RGB Value**

```css
**rgb(255, 99, 71)**
```

**RGBA Value**

RGBA color values are an extension of RGB color values with an alpha channel - which specifies the opacity for a color.

```css
**rgba(255, 99, 71, 0.2)**
```

**CSS HEX Colors**

Specified with: #RRGGBB, where the RR (red), GG (green) and BB (blue) hexadecimal integers specify the components of the color.

```css
 #ff6347

                RED
                ff

                              GREEN
                               63

                                                 BLUE
                                                  47
```

**3 Digit HEX Value(#*rgb*)**

```css
body {
  background-color: #fc9; /* same as #ffcc99 */
}
```

**CSS Background Color**

Example

```html
<h1 style="background-color:DodgerBlue;">Hello World</h1>
```

**CSS Text Color**

```html
<h1 style="color:Tomato;">Hello World</h1>
```

**What is the difference between CSS and SCSS ?**

- **Syntax:** CSS follows a plain-text syntax, whereas SCSS follows a more structured syntax with additional features such as variables, nesting, and mixins.
- **Variables:** SCSS allows you to define variables to store commonly used values such as colors, font sizes, and spacing, whereas CSS does not.
- **Nesting:** SCSS allows you to nest selectors within other selectors, making it easier to write and read complex stylesheets, whereas CSS requires you to write each selector separately.
- **Mixins:** SCSS allows you to create reusable code snippets using mixins, which are like functions in programming languages. CSS does not provide this functionality.
- **File Extension:** CSS files use the .css file extension, while SCSS files use the .scss file extension.
- **Compilation:** CSS files are interpreted by web browsers directly, whereas SCSS files must be preprocessed into standard CSS files using a preprocessor such as Sass.
- SCSS contains all the features of CSS and contains more features that are not present in CSS which makes it a good choice for developers to use it.
- SCSS offers variables, you can shorten your code by using variables. It is a great advantage over conventional CSS.

```css

```html
<style>
div {
  margin: 100px;
  border: 1px solid #4CAF50;
}
</style>
```

CSS has properties for specifying the margin for each side of an element:

- `margin-top`
- `margin-right`
- `margin-bottom`
- `margin-left`

```css
p {
  margin-top: 100px;
  margin-bottom: 100px;
  margin-right: 150px;
  margin-left: 80px;
}
```
```

**CSS COMBINATOR**

A combinator is something that explains the relationship between the selectors.

A CSS selector can contain more than one simple selector. Between the simple selectors, we can include a combinator.

There are four different combinators in CSS:

- descendant selector (space)
- child selector (>)
- adjacent sibling selector (+)
- general sibling selector (~)

The descendant selector matches all elements that are descendants of a specified element.

The following example selects all <p> elements inside <div> elements:

```css
```css
div p {
  background-color: yellow;
}
```

The child selector selects all elements that are the children of a specified element.

The following example selects all <p> elements that are children of a <div> element:

```css
div > p {
  background-color: yellow;
}
```
```
